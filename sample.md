## by Dewey Flynn   

This exciting new tale from the best-selling author of [Master of Puppets]() and [Killer Queen](),
throws former LA County Coroner Chuck Stakes in the middle of an extraordinary adventure that will push
him beyond the breaking point. While on a seemingly idyllic holiday, Chuck quickly finds
himself trapped in the midst of a series of catastrophic events unleashed by the sinister
and shadowy organization known only as ChaOS, that threaten not only his sanity but the
very fabric of civilization as we know it. 

Haunted by a missing library book, Chuck must overcome a complex and diabolical plot surrounding the
mystery of womens' dress sizes. Swept up by forces unseen, Betty, a Harvard symbologist,
is paired with Chuck in an uneasy alliance that will put them to the ultimate test.

Set amidst the exotic backdrops of Rio and Redmond, Chuck and
Betty will make a discovery that will change their world and ours, forever.
Hunted relentlessly by ChaOS, Chuck and Betty have but one chance to stop them. 

Can they do it before time runs out?
