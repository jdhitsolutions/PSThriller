Child in Time
-------------
by Tom Archer

This exciting new tale from the best-selling author of 'Protocol' and 'The Silver Goose',
throws former counter-terrorism specialist Chris Massy in the middle of an extraordinary adventure that will push
them beyond the breaking point. While on a seemingly idyllic holiday, Chris quickly finds
himself trapped in the midst of a series of catastrophic events unleashed by the sinister
and shadowy organization known only as The Office, that threaten not only his sanity but the
very fabric of civilization as we know it.

Haunted by the fear of water, Chris must overcome a complex and diabolical plot surrounding the
mystery of chocolate covered bacon. Swept up by forces unseen, Siri, a dentist,
is paired with Chris in an uneasy alliance that will put them to the ultimate test.

Set amidst the exotic backdrops of the Egyptian pyramids and Newark, Chris and
Siri will make a discovery that will change their world and ours, forever.
Hunted relentlessly by The Office, Chris and Siri have but one chance to stop them.

Can they do it before time runs out?
